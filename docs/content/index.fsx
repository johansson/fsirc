## FsIrc

IRC parsing and network library for F# and .NET, using FParsec.

## Motivation

A staple of learning any programming language, one must implement an IRC library and client. And I found no existing IRC library for F#.

Two main things: FParsec and Functional Reactive Programming.

## Bot

A very crude bot that tests out FRP practices. Also it'll eventually use the parser library.

Change the search patch in `bot.fsx` to point where FSharpx and FParsec are.

`fsi bot.fsx`

## Tests

Change the search path in `tests.fsx` to point where FParsec is.

`fsi tests.fsx`
